# Hardware

The hardware is my interface to what I do. As this is a diy project I have all the chances to get it done "my way".

## Pedal

I own a looper pedal. This is pretty fine to handle. So I decided that I want my band to be in a pedal too!

## Supplies

The supplies should be as much recycled as possible. To reach this goal a bit of hardware abstarction may be in use.
But I will use devices that are widely available vie ebay and other resellers. The hardware should not be limiting the usage in any thing.

## BOM

* RPI [ Zero ]
* SD Card for OS
* SD Card reader (optional)
* SD Card for music (optional)
* USB Cable
* WLAN (optional)
* Bluetooth (optional)

## Hardware setup

Following I will describe the hardware setup and building.

### Audio interface

The audio interface will be independent of the project. As the idea is at the moment to use a RPI Zero there is no analog output.
But my AMP is having USB audio. Due to this, we will use the USB audio. This should work for bluetooth as well.

### Audio connection management

There will be some systemd scripts (I hope) to automagically connect everything and play an connected sound once done!

### IO Wiring

TBD
