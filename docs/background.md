# Background

During Guitar lessons I started playing with some rythm to get into scales and solo's.
This was a lot of fun. As there are plenty of jam tracks it is woth having a look to get them played.

Even there are loopers able to play MP3. The one I have needs to record and then play back. There is no SD Card plugin.
As I am a tinkerer I think there is a chance to get a much fancier thing built.

## Sources

There is a lot of music sources. The most obvios is the CD/MP3. Additional we have youtube and streaming services.
None of the more modern things is a plug and play for an amp.

## Handling

The most "anoying" thing is the handling. Even I have my phone connected to the AMP, there is no hands off handling.
I need to press start and ghet my hands on the guitar. This may be a simple thing if you are good. I am in need to have my hands on first.
This leads to the point where a pedal comes handy.
