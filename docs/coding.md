# Coding

This will be a quick write up of technologies used/preferred.

## Golang
To have an easy upload/functionality we may use golang. This results in an single binary. This will keep away any setup issues once we are non connected.

## Python
Some features like plugins could be python based. There will be a kickstarter to run the python interporeter.

## SQLite
???

## HTTP

The API will be rest bvased. This will enable easy interaction with the device via web app/what ever.

# Git and CI/CD

The project is open source and should be placed on github. Maybe gitlab with a push repo.
This will force me to learn more about gitlab actions. The idea is to have an updater via this.
